# React-Static Github Pages Example

This repository shows an example of a basic [react-static](https://github.com/nozzle/react-static) boilerplate application deployed to [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/).

# Install

```
npm install
```

If getting `node-gyp` errors, it's likely that some packages are out of date.

Try these:
```
$ npm install -g npm-check-updates
$ npm-check-updates -u
$ npm install
```
